- 👋 Hi, I’m @poobalooba
- 👀 I’m interested in ... linux, app development, web development, powershell, coding in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... c# application development, SQL, and Github/Git
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... scripts (bash and powershell), c++ code, maybe some SQL if I feel froggy, and I always welcome criticism
- 📫 How to reach me ... will share at a later time
